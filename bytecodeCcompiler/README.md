# C compiler experiment
Albeit not directly ROBLOX-related, this experiment seeks to create a C compiler that compiles to Lua bytecode. This could be useful for porting real applications to a Lua VM within ROBLOX. Ideally, this will be able to compile itself, essentially creating a C compiler in and for Lua bytecode.
